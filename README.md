## About The Project

[![Identifying Wines][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/usama-akram-gt/Identifying-Wines-Using-Unsupervised-Learning/blob/master/assets/identifying_wines.gif)
Software capable of grouping similar wines together. Software will load a data set containing information about each wine (Alcohol content, alkalinity of ash, Proanthocyanins, colour intensity, etc) 
and identify which wines are similar. Identify a suitable algorithm and design the software for a company using different data structures to accomplish the below.
* Implemented this algorithm using the research paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/) with extended unsupervised learning using weights for K-Mean-Clustering
